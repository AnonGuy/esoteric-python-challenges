## Submissions Guidelines

* Submit your code as a python file named `<yourname>.py`. If your implementation is too big or you simply prefer splitting the code into several files, submit a directory named `<yourname>` with the code inside.
* Add comments that document what language you have implemented (if not your own), how the language works, and how to use the implementation.
