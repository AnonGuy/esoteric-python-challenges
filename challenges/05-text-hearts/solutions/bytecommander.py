You said the focus isn't on golf... but I'll do it anyway.

The following implementation takes a single float number as parameter on STDIN, which is a size factor.
Factor 1 will produce a heart about 34 characters tall and wide, the scale is linear.
Minimum recommended factor is 0.2, below that it gets ugly.

Example: $ python3 bytecommander.py <<< .3

This is a maths-based solution, inspired by the sixth curve on http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html
  x = 16 sinÂ³ t
  y = 13 cos t - 5 cos (2t) - 2 cos (3t) - cos (4t)
with t in [0; 2 pi]

It basically precalculates a set of up to 628 point coordinates (20*pi), rasterized to whole terminal characters according to
the entered scale factor. Then it does a simple print loop and outputs a "#" if this coordinate is in the set of points or 
else a space.
