# Challenge 05 - Text Hearts ❤

## Challenge Overview

It's been a while, but the official esoteric challenges are back! For this challenge, we'll be embracing the current seasonal theme of the server: Valentine's day. Your task is to simply produce a customisable text/ASCII heart. However, the focus is not on code golf this time. Be as beautifully esoteric as you wish with your code, and add a bunch extra features to make it stand out. For example, the size of the outputted heart could be customisable and there could be decorations to choose from as well. You decide!

### Examples

If you're just starting out with esoteric programming, you could create some unusual code to produce the following basic outputs:

Input: 7
Output:
```
 ## ##
#  #  #
#     #
 #   #
  # #
   #
```

Input: 13
Output:
```
 ####   ####
#    # #    #
#     #     #
 #         #
  #       #
   #     #
    #   #
     # #
      #
```

However, the more experienced programmers out there may wish to turn the spice up to 11!

## Restrictions

None!

## Submissions Guidelines

* Submit your code as a python file named `<yourname>.py`. If your implementation is too big or you simply prefer splitting the code into several files, submit a directory named `<yourname>` with the code inside.
