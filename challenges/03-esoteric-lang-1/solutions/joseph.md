# Sef

Sef is my implementation of lexical analysis, AST generation and interpretation.

This is fully educational and is full of bugs, I have no real intention of developing this past the current state it is at, please don't nag me to fix things in it, I will however accept any PRs.

## Dude, it's not esoteric?

I know, I asked nicely and Shawn said that I could just implement a language instead, which gave me something to work on while learning something which might be slightly of use in the future.

## How do I use it?

See the example in the repo, it basically piggy-backs of Python builtins because I'm lazy and can't be bothered to implement my own builtins.
